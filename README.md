# Paradigms-Final-Project
The API is found in _restaurant_database.py and can be imported as helper functions when creating a server. It has get and set functions for restaurants, users, and ratings. 

Restaurants have the following information: 
Latitude, Longitude, Address, City, State, Country, Zipcode,
Name, Alcohol status, smoking rules, dress code, price, parking, cuisine, payments accepted, url, and hours open. 

Users have the following information: 
Cuisine they like, how they can pay, drinking status, smoking status, ambiance prefered, transportation, and budget. 

Users can rate restaurants overall, by food, and by service. 

Ultimately the API will be able to give recommendations based on location, and price, ammendities, and payment type. 
Additionally, users will be able to rate the restaurant.
